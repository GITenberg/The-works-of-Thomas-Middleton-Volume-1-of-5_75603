  <h2 class='c009'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>All the surviving works of Middleton are
comprehended in the present volumes; and
though, perhaps, to a certain class of readers,
a selection from his writings might have been
more acceptable, I am confident that the entire
series is requisite to satisfy the lovers of our
early literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>So rare are some of the pieces now reprinted,
that they were not to be obtained
without considerable difficulty. The original
quartos of <cite>The Triumphs of Integrity</cite>, and <cite>The
Triumphs of Honour and Industry</cite>, are nowhere
to be found but in the dramatic library of the
Duke of Devonshire; and I beg leave respectfully
to express my sense of his Grace’s
liberality and kindness, in granting me permission
to transcribe them.</p>

<p class='c001'>An obligation, for which I am truly grateful,
has been conferred upon me by the Rev. Joseph
Hunter, whose intimate acquaintance with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>genealogical collections of the British Museum
enabled him to point out to me a most important
document, which had escaped my
notice—the pedigree of Middleton in one of
the Harleian MSS.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Charles George Young, Esq., York
Herald, who readily assisted my researches at
the College of Arms; and to Henry Woodthorpe,
Esq., town-clerk of London, who
with equal good will rendered me the same
services at Guildhall, I have to return my sincere
thanks.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Sir Harris Nicolas, John Payne Collier,
Esq., the Rev. John Mitford, and the Rev.
Stephen Reay, sub-librarian of the Bodleian
Library, I have to acknowledge myself indebted
for a variety of useful communications.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thomas Middleton<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> is seldom mentioned by his
contemporaries; and to the scanty materials for his
biography already collected by the curiosity of antiquarian
writers, the facts which I have been enabled
to add, though important, are unfortunately few.</p>

<p class='c001'>His father was William Middleton; concerning
whom I have found no earlier notice than is contained
in the following document, which affords unquestionable
evidence that he was a gentleman by
birth:</p>

<p class='c001'>William Middleton appears to have settled in
the metropolis.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> He married<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Anne, daughter of
William Snow, of London; and by her had two
children,—Thomas, the subject of the present memoir;
and Avicia,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> who first became the wife of
John Empson, of London, and afterwards of Alan
Waterer, of the same city.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>The date of the poet’s birth, which is matter of
conjecture,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> I am inclined to fix not earlier than 1570.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was probably about 1603 that he married
Maria,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> daughter of Edward Morbeck,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of London,
one of the Six Clerks of Chancery, by Barbara,
daughter of William Palmer, of Warwickshire. A
son, named Edward, the only issue of this marriage,
was alive in 1623, aged nineteen. If there be no
error in the MS. from which the above information
has been derived, and if the entry among the City
Records, which is cited in another part of this memoir,
be also correct, Middleton must have married a
second time, either during 1623 or subsequently to
that year, for, according to the latter authority, the
name of his widow was Magdalen.</p>

<p class='c001'>A “Tho. Middleton” was admitted member of
Gray’s Inn in 1593, a second in 1596, and a third in
1606.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Of these individuals, the first is more likely
than either of the others to have been the dramatist.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span><cite>The Wisdom of Solomon Paraphrased, Written
by Thomas Middleton</cite>, 1597, has generally been
assigned to our author; and since no other poet
of the same name is known to have existed in
those days,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> I have thought myself obliged, notwithstanding
its length and tediousness, to reprint
it entire. <cite>Micro-cynicon, Six Snarling Satires</cite>,
1599, has also been attributed to him, because the
prefatory verses are subscribed “T. M. Gent.;” and
as it possesses at least the doubtful merit of shortness,
I have not rejected it from the present collection.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>But of whatever kind were his earliest (and perhaps
unsuccessful) efforts to attract the notice of
the public, it is evident that Middleton devoted the
maturity of his powers almost exclusively to dramatic
composition, though the period at which he
commenced a writer for the stage cannot be determined.
There are grounds for believing that <cite>The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Old Law</cite> was first produced in 1599.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Of that play,
a portion only is by him—a portion is by William
Rowley; and subsequently it received improvements
from the pen of Massinger, who when it was originally
acted had not completed his fifteenth year.
The reader ought to remember, that dramas which
bear on their title-pages the names of more than one
author were not necessarily written by those authors
in conjunction: that popular playwrights were often
employed to alter and to add to pieces which had
ceased to be attractive, is a fact sufficiently established
by the valuable memoranda of Henslowe.
We are not, however, to conclude that the other
dramas of which Middleton was only in part the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>author were wrought into their present form by such
a process.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is unnecessary to enumerate all the various
pieces with which, during a long series of years, he
continued to enrich the stage; nor would it be possible
to ascertain the exact order in which they were
produced. Henslowe’s papers supply the following
notices of two which perhaps were never printed,
and are no longer extant:</p>

<p class='c016'>“May 1602. Two Harpies, by Dekker, Drayton,
Middleton, Webster, and Mundy.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Oct. 1602. Randall, earl of Chester, by T. Middleton.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>And among the MS. plays which belonged to Warburton
the Somerset Herald, and which, according
to his own cool statement, “were unluckely burnd
or put under Pye-bottoms,” there was one entitled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>“The Puritan Maid, the Modest Wife, and the
Wanton Widow, by Tho. Middleton.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two tracts, which issued separately from the
press in 1604, <cite>The Black Book</cite>, and <cite>Father Hubburd’s
Tales, or The Ant and the Nightingale</cite>, I
assign, with little hesitation, to Middleton: in both
the Epistle to the Reader is subscribed “T. M.,”
and in both are found expressions which remind us
strongly of his dramatic dialogue. They are coarse
but humorous attacks on the vices and follies of
the time; and are peculiarly interesting on account
of the passages which relate to Thomas Nash,<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>whose admirable prose-satires they may be considered
as no unhappy imitations. The verses interwoven
with <i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i> are occasionally very
graceful.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Inner Temple Masque</cite>, written, I apprehend,
in 1618, and <cite>The World tost at Tennis</cite>, first
produced as a royal entertainment, and afterwards
brought out with alterations, probably in 1620, are
the only pieces of the kind which we possess from
our author’s pen; but it appears, by an entry in
the City Records, that he had been called on at an
earlier date to compose a masque, of which the title
alone remains:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>With the representation of <cite>A Game at Chess</cite> in
1624 is connected the most memorable incident of
our poet’s history. In this singular drama he ventured
to bring upon the stage both the English and
the Spanish court; much of the satire being levelled
at Gondomar, who is unmercifully held up to ridicule
not only for his political intrigues, but even
for his bodily infirmities. “Prince Charles,” says
Mr. Collier, “returned from Spain, after the breaking
off the match with the Infanta, late in the autumn
of 1623; and to take advantage of the popular feeling
upon this question, Middleton’s play was probably
written in the succeeding spring, and certainly
acted at the Globe in the summer.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> <cite>A Game at
Chess</cite> could hardly fail to prove attractive; and it
had already been performed (as the 4tos state) “for
nine days together,” when the exhibition was suddenly
prohibited by a royal mandate, and both the
author and the actors were cited before the Privy
Council. A detail of the proceedings in this curious
affair is supplied by the following letters.</p>

<p class='c026'>Mr. Secretary Conway to the Privy Council:</p>

<p class='c001'>“May it please your Lordships,—His Majesty
hath received information from the Spanish Ambassador
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>of a very scandalous comedy acted publickly
by the King’s players, wherein they take the boldness
and presumption, in a rude and dishonourable fashion,
to represent on the stage the persons of his Majesty,
the King of Spain, the Conde de Gondomar, the
Bishop of Spalato, &#38;c. His Majesty remembers
well there was a commandment and restraint given
against the representing of any modern Christian
kings in those stage-plays; and wonders much
both at the boldness now taken by that company,
and also that it hath been permitted to be so acted,
and that the first notice thereof should be brought to
him by a foreign ambassador, while so many ministers
of his own are thereabouts, and cannot but have
heard of it. His Majesty’s pleasure is, that your
Lordships presently call before you as well the poet
that made the comedy as the comedians that acted
it: And upon examination of them to commit them,
or such of them as you shall find most faulty, unto
prison, if you find cause, or otherwise take security
for their forthcoming; and then certify his Majesty
what you find that comedy to be, in what points it
is most offensive, by whom it was made, by whom
licensed, and what course you think fittest to be
held for the examplary and severe punishment of
the present offenders, and to restrain such insolent
and licentious presumption for the future. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>the charge I have received from his Majesty, and
with it I make bold to offer to your Lordships the
humble service of, &#38;c. From Rufford, August
12<sup>th</sup>, 1624.”</p>

<p class='c026'>The Privy Council to Mr. Secretary Conway:</p>

<p class='c001'>“After our hearty commendations, &#38;c.—According
to his Majesty’s pleasure signified to this
board by your letter of the 12<sup>th</sup> August, touching
the suppressing of a scandalous comedy acted by
the King’s players, we have called before us some
of the principal actors and demanded of them by
what license and authority they have presumed to
act the same; in answer whereto they produced a
book being an original and perfect copy thereof (as
they affirmed) seen and allowed by Sir Henry Herbert
Knᵗ, Master of the Revels, under his own hand,
and subscribed in the last page of the said book:
We demanding further, whether there were not
other parts or passages represented on the stage
than those expressly contained in the book, they
confidently protested, they added or varied from the
same nothing at all. The poet, they tell us, is one
Middleton, who shifting out of the way, and not
attending the board with the rest, as was expected,
we have given warrant to a messenger for the apprehending
of him. To those that were before us
we gave a sound and sharp reproof, making them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>sensible of his Majesty’s high displeasure herein,
giving them straight charge and commands that they
presumed not to act the said comedy any more, nor
that they suffered any play or interlude whatsoever
to be acted by them or any of their company until
his Majesty’s pleasure be further known. We have
caused them likewise to enter into bond for their
attendance upon the board whensoever they shall
be called. As for our certifying to his Majesty (as
was intimated by your letter) what passages in the
said comedy we should find to be offensive and
scandalous; We have thought it our duties for his
Majesty’s clearer information to send herewithal the
book itself subscribed as aforesaid by the Master of
the Revels, that so either yourself or some other
whom his Majesty shall appoint to peruse the same,
may see the passages themselves out of the original,
and call Sir Henry Herbert before you to know a
reason of his licensing thereof, who (as we are given
to understand) is now attending at court; So having
done as much as we conceived agreeable with our
duties in conformity to his Majesty’s royal commandments,
and that which we hope shall give him
full satisfaction, we shall continue our humble prayers
to Almighty God for his health and safety; and
bid you very heartily farewell. [Dated the 21st of
August, 1624.]”</p>
<p class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>Mr. Secretary Conway to the Privy Council:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Right Honourable,—His Majesty having received
satisfaction in your Lordships’ endeavours,
and in the signification thereof to him by yours of
the 21st of this present, hath commanded me to
signify the same to you. And to add further, that
his pleasure is, that your Lordships examine by
whose direction and application the personating of
Gondomar and others was done; and that being
found out, the party or parties to be severely
punished, his Majesty being unwilling for one’s sake
and only fault to punish the innocent or utterly to
ruin the company. The discovery on what party
his Majesty’s justice is properly and duly to fall,
and your execution of it and the account to be
returned thereof, his Majesty leaves to your Lordships’
wisdoms and care. And this being that I
have in charge, continuing the humble offer of my
service and duty to the attendance of your commandments,

<p class='c001'>Complaynt being made unto his Majesty
against the Company of his Comedians, for acting
publiquely a Play knowne by the name of a Game
at Chesse, contayning some passages in it reflecting
in matter of scorne and ignominy upon the King of
Spaine, some of his Ministers and others of good
note and quality, his Majesty out of the tender
regard hee had of that King’s honor and those of
his Ministers who were conceived to bee wounded
thereby, caused his letters to bee addressed to my
Lords and the rest of his most honᵇˡᵉ Privy Council,
thereby requiring them to convent those his Comedians
before them, and to take such course with
them for this offence as might give best satisfaction
to the Spanish Ambassador and to their owne Honnors.
After examination that honᵇˡᵉ Board thought
fitt not onely to interdict them playing of that play,
but of any other also, untill his Majesty should give
way unto them. And for their obedience hereunto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>they weare bound in 300<sup>li</sup> bondes. Which punishment
when they had suffered (as his Majesty conceives)
a competent tyme, upon their petition delivered
heere unto him, it pleased his Majesty to
comaund mee to lett your Lordship understand
(which I pray your Lordship to impart to the rest
of that honᵇˡᵉ Board) that his Majesty now conceives
the punishment, if not satisfactory for that their
insolency, yet such as since it stopps the current of
their poore livelyhood and mainteanance, without
much prejudice they cannot longer undergoe. In
consideration therefore of those his poore servants,
his Majesty would have their Lordships connive at
any common play lycensed by authority, that they
shall act as before. As for this of the Game at
Chesse, that it bee not onely antiquated and sylenced,
but the Players bound as formerly they
weare, and in that point onely never to act it
agayne. Yet nothwithstanding that my Lords proceed
in their disquisition to fynd out the originall
roote of this offence, whether it sprang from the
Poet, Players, or both, and to certefy his Majesty
accordingly. And so desireing your Lordship to

What he states concerning the imprisonment of Middleton,

has not noticed the latter part of the memorandum)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>remarks, that “the reason why no punishment

<p class='c001'>In a letter by Howel from Madrid, addressed
to Sir John North, there is an evident allusion to
Middleton’s notorious drama: “I am sorry to hear
how other Nations do much tax the English of their
Incivility to public Ministers of State; and what
Ballads and Pasquils and Fopperies and Plays were
made against Gondamar for doing his Masters business.”<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a>

gross passage about Gondomar and “the poor English
play was writ of him.”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span><cite>The Triumphs of Health and Prosperity</cite>, 1626,
was the last piece composed by Middleton for the
entertainment of the city; and it was also, perhaps,
the last effort of his pen.</p>

<p class='c001'>That in 1623 he resided at Newington Butts,<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a> has

<p class='c001'>The following lines have been frequently adduced
as a testimony that our author was far advanced in

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_l'>l</span>Three of our author’s pieces are recorded to have
been performed after the Restoration, <cite>A Trick to
catch the Old One</cite>, <cite>The Widow</cite>, and <cite>The Changeling</cite>;
but at the commencement of the eighteenth
century his writings may be considered as forgotten.</p>

<p class='c001'>The publication of Dodsley’s <cite>Old Plays</cite><a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a> in 1744
had some effect in reviving the faded reputation of
Middleton; and in 1778 his name was made still
more familiar to the literary world, when copies of
<cite>The Witch</cite>, printed from a MS. in the possession
of Major Pearson,<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> were circulated by Isaac Reed.
Besides the less important discovery that D’Avenant
had availed himself of this drama in his alteration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_li'>li</span>of <cite>Macbeth</cite>,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> it was evident that the resemblance
between the scenes of enchantment in <cite>The Witch</cite>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lii'>lii</span>and those in Shakespeare’s tragedy as originally
written, must have been more than accidental.
Steevens maintained that Shakespeare was the imitator.
Malone at first coincided in that opinion;
but receding from it at a later period of life, he endeavoured
to establish by a lengthy dissertation that
the performance of <cite>Macbeth</cite> (which he fixes in
1606<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a>), was anterior to that of <cite>The Witch</cite>; and
though his reasoning appears to me very far from
convincing, I am by no means disposed to assert
that the conclusion at which he has so laboriously
arrived is not the right one.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Gifford, indeed, has
unhesitatingly pronounced that Shakespeare was the
copyist;<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> but, notwithstanding the respect which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liii'>liii</span>entertain for that critic, his incidental remarks on
the present question have little weight with me:
he has assigned no grounds for his decision; he had
not, I apprehend, considered the subject with much
attention; and on two occasions at least, he appears
to have alluded to it chiefly for the sake of giving
additional force to the blows which he happened
to be aiming at the luckless “commentators.” As
Shakespeare undoubtedly possessed the creative
power in its utmost perfection, and as no satisfactory
evidence has been adduced to shew that <cite>The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liv'>liv</span>Witch</cite> was acted at an earlier period than <cite>Macbeth</cite>,
he must not be hastily accused of imitation. Yet
since he is known to have frequently remodelled the
works of other writers, it may be urged, that when
he had to introduce witches into his tragedy, he
would hardly scruple to borrow from our author’s
play<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a> as much as suited his immediate purpose.
But, after all, there is an essential difference<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> between
the hags of Shakespeare and of Middleton; and
whichever of the two may have been the copyist,
he owes so little to his brother-poet, that the debt
will not materially affect his claim to originality.
Concerning the tragi-comedy <cite>The Witch</cite>, I have only
to add, that its merit consists entirely in the highly
imaginative pictures of the preternatural agents, in
their incantations, and their moonlight revelry: the
rest of it rises little above mediocrity.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the estimation of an anonymous critic, <cite>Women
beware Women</cite> is “Middleton’s finest play,”<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a> and
perhaps he has judged rightly. It is indeed remarkable
for the masterly conception and delineation of
the chief characters, and for the life and reality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lv'>lv</span>infused into many of the scenes; though the dramatis
personæ are almost all repulsive from their
extreme depravity, and the catastrophe is rather
forced and unnatural. In this tragedy, says Hazlitt,
there is “a rich marrowy vein of internal sentiment,
with fine occasional insight into human nature, and
cool cutting irony of expression.”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a> To his subsequent
observation, that “the interest decreases,
instead of increasing, as we read on,” I by no means
assent.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Changeling</cite> affords another specimen of
Middleton’s tragic powers. If on the whole inferior
to the piece last mentioned, it displays, I think,
in several places, a depth of passion unequalled
throughout the present volumes. According to the
title-page, William Rowley, who was frequently his
literary associate, had a share in the composition;
but I feel convinced that the terribly impressive
passages of this tragedy, as well as those serious
portions of <cite>A Fair Quarrel</cite> which Lamb has deservedly
praised, and the pleasing characters of Clara
and Constanza in <cite>The Spanish Gipsy</cite>, are beyond
the ability of Rowley.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among our author’s works there are few more
original and ingenious than <cite>A Game at Chess</cite>. By
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvi'>lvi</span>touches of sweet fancy, by quaint humour, and by
poignant satire, he redeems the startling absurdities
in which the plan of the drama had necessarily involved
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Middleton’s “principal efforts,” says an accomplished
writer, “were in comedy, where he deals profusely
in grossness and buffoonery. The cheats and
debaucheries of the town are his favourite sources of
comic intrigue.”<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> <cite>A Mad World, my Masters</cite>, and
<cite>A Trick to catch the Old One</cite>, are the most perfect
of the numerous comedies which Mr. Campbell has
dismissed with so slight and unfavourable a notice;
and next to them may be ranked <cite>The Roaring Girl</cite>,<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
<cite>A Chaste Maid in Cheapside</cite>, <cite>Michaelmas Term</cite>,
and <cite>No Wit, no Help like a Woman’s</cite>. The dialogue
of these pieces is generally spirited; the characters,
though their peculiarities may be sometimes exaggerated,
are drawn with breadth and discrimination;
and the crowded incidents afford so much amusement,
that the reader is willing to overlook the occasional
violation of probability. As they faithfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvii'>lvii</span>reflect the manners and customs of the age, even
the worst of Middleton’s comedies<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> are not without
their value.</p>

<p class='c001'>A critic, whom I have already quoted, after
observing that “it is difficult to assign Middleton
any precise station among the remarkable men who
were his contemporaries,”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> proceeds to compare him
with Webster and Ford, who were assuredly poets
of a higher order. The dramatists with whom, in
my opinion, Middleton ought properly to be classed—though
superior to him in some respects and
inferior in others—are Dekker, Heywood, Marston,
and Chapman: nor perhaps does William Rowley
fall so much below them that he should be excluded
from the list.</p>

<p class='c038'>Steevens (Malone’s <cite>Shakespeare</cite>, by Boswell, ii. 425.) remarks,
that this drama was acted in 1599, founding the statement
most probably on a passage in Act iii. Sc. 1., where the
Clerk having read from the church-book, “<cite>Agatha, the daughter
of Pollux—born in an. 1540</cite>,” adds, “and <i>now ’tis 99</i>.” From
similar notices in several other old dramas, the periods at
which they were first produced have been clearly ascertained;
and Gifford (<cite>Introd.</cite> to Massinger, p. lv. 2d ed.) inclines to
believe that <cite>The Old Law</cite> was really first acted in 1599, and
that Massinger (who was then only in the fifteenth year of his
age) was employed, at a subsequent period, to alter or to add
a few scenes to the play. What portion of it was written by
Middleton cannot be determined.</p>

<p class='c038'>The 4to. abounds in the grossest typographical errors. I
have followed, except in some trifling particulars, the text of
Gifford, who published <cite>The Old Law</cite> in the ivth vol. of his
Massinger.</p>

<p class='c038'>“There is an exquisiteness of moral sensibility, making
one to gush out tears of delight, and a poetical strangeness in
all the improbable circumstances of this wild play, which are
unlike any thing in the dramas which Massinger wrote alone.
The pathos is of a subtler edge. Middleton and Rowley, who
assisted in this play, had both of them finer geniuses than
their associate.”—<span class='sc'>Lamb</span>, <cite>Spec. of Engl. Dram. Poets</cite>, p. 453.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Whose daughter, say you?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> The daughter of Pollux.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> I take it his name was Bollux.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Pollux the orthography I assure you,
sir; the word is corrupted else.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Well, on, sir,—of Pollux; now come on,
Castor.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> <em>Born in an.</em> 1540, and now ’tis 99. By
this infallible record, sir, (let me see,) she is now
just fifty-nine, and wants but one.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> I am sorry she wants so much.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Why, sir? alas, ’tis nothing; ’tis but so
many months, so many weeks, so many——</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Do not deduct it to days,<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c015'><sup>[166]</sup></a> ’twill be the
more tedious; and to measure it by hourglasses
were intolerable.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Do not think on it, sir; half the time
goes away in sleep, ’tis half the year in nights.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> O, you mistake me, neighbour, I am
loath to leave the good old woman; if she were gone
now it would not grieve me; for what is a year,
alas, but a lingering torment? and were it not better
she were out of her pain? ’T must needs be a
grief to us both.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> I would I knew how to ease you, neighbour!</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> You speak kindly, truly, and if you say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>but Amen to it, (which is a word that I know you
are perfect in,) it might be done. Clerks are the
most indifferent honest men,—for to the marriage
of your enemy, or the burial of your friend, the
curses or the blessings to you are all one; you say
Amen to all.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> With a better will to the one than the
other, neighbour: but I shall be glad to say Amen
to any thing might do you a pleasure.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> There is, first, something above your
duty: [<i>Gives him money</i>] now I would have you
set forward the clock a little, to help the old woman
out of her pain.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> I will speak to the sexton;<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a> but the day
will go ne’er the faster for that.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> O, neighbour, you do not conceit me;
not the jack of the clock-house; the hand of the
dial, I mean.—Come, I know you, being a great
clerk, cannot choose but have the art to cast a
figure.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Never, indeed, neighbour; I never had
the judgment to cast a figure.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> I’ll shew you on the back side of your
book, look you,—what figure’s this?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Four with a cipher, that’s forty.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> So! forty; what’s this now?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> The cipher is turned into 9 by adding
the tail, which makes forty-nine.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Very well understood; what is’t now?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> The 4 is turned into 3; ’tis now thirty-nine.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Very well understood; and can you do
this again?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> O, easily, sir.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> A wager of that! let me see the place of
my wife’s age again.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Look you, sir, ’tis here, 1540.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Forty drachmas, you do not turn that
forty into thirty-nine.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> A firm match—but stay, sir, now I consider
it, I shall add a year to your wife’s age; let
me see—<a id='e1.50.11'></a><i><a href='#errata1.50.11'>Scirophorion</a></i> the 17,—and now ’tis <i>Hecatombaion</i>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Nay, sir, I would have you keep counsel;
for I lose my money by’t, and should be
laughed at for my labour, if it should be known.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> Well, sir, there!—’tis done; as perfect

thou, tailor?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Tail.</span> I do so, so; but, indeed, all our wants are

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Cook.</span> The truth is, except the coachman and
the footman, all serving-men are out of request.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Nay, say not so, for you were never in

request it; and in that kind of requesting, I am
sure serving-men were never in more request.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Cook.</span> Troth, he says true: well, let that pass,
we are upon a better adventure. I see, Gnotho,<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c015'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
you have been before us; we came to deal with
this merchant for some commodities.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>But.</span> Nay, we have looked out our wives already:

we bear to age, that the more aged, they shall be

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Tail.</span> The truth is, every man has laid by his
widow; so they be lame enough, blind enough,

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Clerk.</span> I keep the town-stock; if you can but

either drink or eat.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Bail.</span> I will strive for no place; the longer ere

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> I commend your modesty, sir; you are

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Gnoth.</span> Take that at hazard, sir; there must be

</div>

<p class='c054'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><i>The Mayor of Quinborough: A Comedy. As it hath been
often Acted with much Applause at Black-Fryars, By His Majesties
Servants. Written by Tho. Middleton. London, Printed
for Henry Herringman, and are to be sold at his Shop at the
Sign of the Blew-Anchor in the Lower-Walk of the New-Exchange.</i>
1661. 4to.</p>

<p class='c055'>From the introduction of an individual as a chorus, and of
dumb shows (such as we find in <i>Pericles</i>, and other dramas
of an early date), we may gather that this piece was among the
author’s first attempts at dramatic composition. Nor does
the mention made in it of a play called the <i>Wild-Goose Chase</i>,
even supposing that Fletcher’s comedy be meant, overthrow
such a conclusion. The passage where that mention occurs
(Act v. Sc. i.) might have been inserted when the <i>Mayor of
Queenborough</i> was revived, at a period long after its first
appearance on the stage: (every reader of our old dramas is
aware that play-wrights were often employed to make “additions”
to the works of their predecessors): it might, indeed,
have been written by Middleton himself, after the appearance
of Fletcher’s play, which was produced about 1621.</p>

<p class='c055'>When Henslowe in his diary notices “Oct. 1602. Randall,
Earl of Chester, by T. Middleton,” Malone thinks (why,
I know not,) that the <i>Mayor of Queenborough</i> is meant.</p>

<p class='c055'>This drama has been reprinted in the different editions of
Dodsley’s <i>Coll. of Old Plays</i>, vol. xi.</p>

<p class='c055'>“The author,” says Langbaine, “has chiefly followed Rainulph’s
<i>Polychronicon</i>: see besides Stowe, Speed, Du Chesne,
&#38;c. in the reign of Vortiger.”—<i>Account of Dram. Poets</i>, p. 372.</p>

<p class='c055'>You have the first flight of him, I assure you.
This <i>Mayor of Queenborough</i>, whom you have all
heard of, and some of you beheld upon the stage,
now begins to walk abroad in print: he has been
known sufficiently by the reputation of his wit,
which is enough, by the way, to distinguish him
from ordinary mayors; but wit, you know, has
skulked in corners for many years past,<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c015'><sup>[354]</sup></a> and he was
thought to have most of it that could best hide himself.
Now whether this magistrate feared the decimating
times, or kept up the state of other mayors,
that are bound not to go out of their liberties during
the time of their mayoralty, I know not: ’tis enough
for me to put him into your hands, under the title
of an honest man, which will appear plainly to you,
because you shall find him all along to have a great
pique to the rebel Oliver. I am told his drollery
yields to none the English drama did ever produce;
and though I would not put his modesty to the
blush, by speaking too much in his commendation,
yet I know you will agree with me, upon your better
acquaintance with him, that there is some difference
in point of wit betwixt the <cite>Mayor of Queenborough</cite>
and the <cite>Mayor of Huntingdon</cite>.<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c015'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Sim.</span> The deadly sins will scorn to rise by thee, if
they have any breeding, as commonly they are well
brought up; ’tis not for every scab to be acquainted
with them: but leaving the scab, to you, good
neighbours, now I bend my speech. First, to say
more than a man can say, I hold it not fit to be
spoken; but to say what a man ought to say, there
I leave you also. I must confess your loves have
chosen a weak and unlearned man; that I can
neither write nor read, you all can witness: yet not
altogether so unlearned, but I can set my mark to a
bond, if I would be so simple; an excellent token
of government. Cheer you then, my hearts, you
have done you know not what: there’s a full point;
there you must all cough and hem. [<i>Here they all
cough and hem.</i>] Now touching our common adversary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the fustian-weaver, who threatens he will raise
the deadly sins among us, let them come; our town
is big enough to hold them, we will not so much
disgrace it; besides, you know a deadly sin will lie
in a narrow hole: but when they think themselves
safest, and the web of their iniquity best woven,
with the horse strength of my justice I will break
through the loom of their concupiscence, and make
the weaver go seek his shuttle: here you may
cough and hem again, if you’ll do me the favour.
[<i>They cough and hem again.</i>] Why, I thank you all,
and it shall not go unrewarded. Now for the deadly
sins, pride, sloth, envy, wrath; as for covetousness
and gluttony, I’ll tell you more when I come out of
my office; I shall have time to try what they are:
I will prove them soundly; and if I find gluttony
and covetousness to be directly sins, I’ll bury the
one in the bottom of a chest, and the other in the
end of my garden. But, sirs, for lechery, I’ll tickle
that home myself, I’ll not leave a whore in the
town.</p>

To conclude, I will learn the villany of all trades;
my own I know already: if there be any knavery
in the baker, I will bolt it out; if in the brewer, I
will taste him throughly,<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c015'><sup>[464]</sup></a> and piss out his iniquity

brother in this equalled him who did most. He
went from you a worthy gentleman; he brings
with him that title that makes a gentleman most
worthy, the name of a soldier; which how well
and how soon he hath earned, would in me seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>glorious to rehearse, in you to hear; but, because
his own ear dwells so near my voice, I will play
the ill neighbour, and cease to speak well of him.</p>

ever in love.</p>

some men have died for love.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Viol.</span> So have I, but I could never see’t. I’d
ride forty miles to follow such a fellow to church;

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Cam.</span> Take you such delight in men that die for

that I should marry? was I drunk? yet that cannot
altogether hold, for it was four a’ clock i’ th’
morning; had it been five, I would ha’ sworn it.
That a man is in danger every minute to be cast
away, without he have an extraordinary pilot that
can perform more than a man can do! and to say
truth too, when I’m abroad, what can I do at
home? no man living can reach so far: and what
a horrible thing ’twould be to have horns brought
me at sea, to look as if the devil were i’ th’ ship!
and all the great tempests would be thought of my
raising! to be the general curse of all merchants!
and yet they likely are as deep in as myself; and
that’s a comfort. O, that a captain should live to
be married! nay, I that have been such a gallant
salt-thief, should yet live to be married! What a
fortunate elder brother is he, whose father being a
rammish ploughman, himself a perfumed gentleman
spending the labouring reek from his father’s nostrils
in tobacco, the sweat of his father’s body in
monthly physic for his pretty queasy<a id='r803'></a><a href='#f803' class='c015'><sup>[803]</sup></a> harlot! he
sows apace i’ th’ country; the tailor o’ertakes him
i’ th’ city, so that oftentimes before the corn comes
to earing,<a id='r804'></a><a href='#f804' class='c015'><sup>[804]</sup></a> ’tis up to the ears in high collars, and so
at every harvest the reapers take pains for the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Would my father had held a plough so, and
fed upon squeezed curds and onions, that I might
have bathed in sensuality! but he was too ruttish

before he got me; and that makes me so wretched
now to be shackled with a wife, and not greatly

such sweet pleasure in the vexation of others, that
I could wish my years over and over again, to see
that fellow a beggar, that bawling knave a gentleman,
a matter brought e’en to a judgment to-day,
as far as e’er ’twas to begin again to-morrow: O

that’s three; I was called cuckold for my labour,

five; then one called me wittol,<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c015'><sup>[824]</sup></a> that’s six; he
killed my dog for barking, seven; my maid-servant
was knocked at that time, eight; my wife miscarried
with a push, nine; <span lang="la"><i>et sic de cæteris</i></span>. I
have so vexed and beggared the whole parish with
process, subpœnas, and such-like molestations, they
are not able to spare so much ready money from a

churchwardens are fain to go to law with the poors’
money.</p>

that ’tis impossible to be at civil cuckoldry
within ourselves, unless the whole country rise
upon our wives.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Phœ.</span> Nay, an excellent stratagem: but of all I
most wonder at the continual substance of thy wit,
that, having had so many suits in law from time to
time, thou hast still money to relieve ’em.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span><span class='sc'>Tan.</span> Why do you so much wonder at that?
Why, this is my course: my mare and I come up

little to their profit; buzzing into their ears this
course, that writ, this office, that <span lang="la"><i>ultimum refugium</i></span>;
as you know I have words enow for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Tan.</span> Another special trick I have, no body must
know it, which is, to prefer most of those men to
one attorney, whom I affect best: to answer which
kindness of mine, he will sweat the better in my
cause, and do them the less good: take’t of my
word, I helped my attorney to more clients the

the tobacco-pipe new dropt out of his mouth

Well, he was too honest to live, and that
made him die so soon. Now I beshrew my heart,
I am glad he’s in heaven, has left all his cares and
troubles with me, and that great vexation of telling
of money: yet I hope he had so much grace before

not so much as spit but within line and fashion.

and invite ’em to-morrow to another breakfast of

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> Did you not hear me say, I had rather ha’

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Sho.</span> Very true, sir; but this gentleman lighting

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> You did well in that, I must needs say,
for your own securities: but ’twas not my mind,
master Easy, to have you first; you must needs
think so.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Easy.</span> I dare swear that, master Quomodo.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> But since you are come to me, I have no
reason to refuse you; I should shew little manners
in that, sir.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Easy.</span> But I hope you spake not in that sense,
sir, to impose the bond upon me?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> By my troth, that’s my meaning, sir; you
shall find me an honest man; you see I mean what
I say. Is not the day past, the money untendered?
you’d ha’ me live uprightly, master Easy?</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Easy.</span> Why, sir, you know master Blastfield is

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> Marry, does it, sir—these fellows know
the law—beside, you offered yourself into bond to
me, you know, when I had no stomach to you:
now beshrew your heart for your labour! I might
ha’ had a good substantial citizen, that would ha’
paid the sum roundly, although I think you sufficient
enough for seven hundred pound: beside
the forfeiture, I would be loath to disgrace you so

not think but master Blastfield is at carrier’s

you the better discharged. I wonder he should
break with me; ’twas never his practice. You
must not be angry with me now, though you were
somewhat hot when you entered into bond; you
may easily go in angrily, but you cannot come
out so.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Easy.</span> No, the devil’s in’t for that!</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Sho.</span> I told you so.</p>

are sometimes gulls to gentlemen, I thank ’em;
but gentlemen are never gulls to us, I commend
’em.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Sho.</span> Under your leave, master Quomodo, the

it sorts well with our occasion at this time, having
a little urgent business at Guildhall; at which

made.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Easy.</span> You tell me of that still which is no fault
of mine, master Quomodo.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> O, what’s a man but his honesty, master
Easy? and that’s a fault amongst most of us all.
Mark but this note; I’ll give you good counsel
now. As often as you give your name to a bond,
you must think you christen a child, and take the
charge on’t, too; for as the one, the bigger it
grows, the more cost it requires, so the other, the
longer it lies, the more charges it puts you to.
Only here’s the difference; a child must be broke,
and a bond must not; the more you break children,
the more you keep ’emunder; but the more you
break bonds, the more they’ll leap in your face;
and therefore, to conclude, I would never undertake
to be gossip<a id='r1084'></a><a href='#f1084' class='c015'><sup>[1084]</sup></a> to that bond which I would not
see well brought up.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Easy.</span> Say you so, sir? I’ll think upon your
counsel hereafter for’t.</p>

<p class='c044 prose'><span class='sc'>Quo.</span> Ah fool, thou shouldest ne’er ha’ tasted
such wit, but that I know ’tis too late! <span class='stagedir5'>[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

lordship ... as if one fate did prosperously cleave to
<em>one name</em>,” &#38;c., vol. v. p. 217. The family of Sir Thomas Middleton

<p class='c001'>But the compiler has given them to our author by mistake:
both are taken from <cite>The Legend of Humphrey Duke of Glocester</cite>,
written by <span class='sc'>Christopher</span> Middleton; see the reprint of
that poem in the tenth vol. of <cite>The Harleian Miscellany</cite>,
p. 170 and p. 182. ed. Park.</p>

the Lady Mary his Sister, the 27th of February, at the Colledge
of the Mvseum Minervæ.</cite> <i>London</i>, 1635. 4to, has been
ascribed to Middleton by those who were not aware that he was
dead at that period.</p>

<p class='c087'>Lowndes (<cite>Bibliog. Manual</cite>) attributes to Middleton <cite>The
pleasant comodie of Patient Grissell</cite>, 1607, and a short tract
called <cite>Sir Robert Sherley sent Ambassadour, in the name of
the King of Persia, to Sigismond the Third</cite>, &#38;c. &#38;c. 1609. 4to.
The former piece was written by Dekker, Chettle, and Haughton
(see Malone’s <cite>Shakespeare</cite>, by Boswell, vol. iii. p. 323);
the latter (which is reprinted in <cite>The Harleian Miscellany</cite>,
vol. v.) has no author’s name, and, as far as I can discover,
contains nothing to indicate that it is by Middleton.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. In act iii. scene 1. (vol. i. p. 48), the Clerk having read
from the church-book “<cite>Agatha, the daughter of Pollux—born
in an. 1540</cite>,” adds, “and <span class='fss'>NOW ’TIS</span> 99.” Similar notices have
served to ascertain the periods at which several other old dramas
were first brought upon the stage; but they are not always to
be relied on as evidence to that effect. In our author’s <cite>No
Wit, No Help like a Woman’s</cite>, act iii. scene 1. (vol. v. p. 87),
Weatherwise says, “If I, that have proceeded in five-and-twenty
such books of astronomy, should not be able to put
down a scholar <cite>now in one thousand six hundred thirty and
eight</cite>, the dominical letter being G, I stood for a goose.” That
Middleton wrote this play there cannot, I think, be any doubt;
but as he had been dead about ten years before 1638, that
date must have been inserted by the actors when the piece was
revived.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. <i>Id. ibid.</i> There can be no question that this is the piece
which, according to Mr. Collier, in a part of Henslowe’s Diary
not cited by Malone, is called <cite>The Chester Tragedy</cite>. <cite>Hist. of
Engl. Dram. Poetry</cite>, vol. iii. p. 102. When Malone (<span lang="la"><i>ubi supra</i></span>)

<p class='c001'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. <a id='e1.xviii.note'></a>In vol. v. p. 527 and p. 562, I followed Mr. Collier’s
statement (<cite>Bridgewater House Catalogue</cite>, p. 200), that Nash
died during 1604, because in <cite>The Black Book</cite> he is described
as alive, and in <i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i> he is spoken of
as dead, both these pieces having been published in 1604.
But Nash must have died earlier; for, in <cite>The Returne from
Pernassus</cite>, 1606, which internal evidence proves to have been
written before the decease of Elizabeth, he is mentioned as
being “in his mournefull chest,” sig. <span class='fss'>B</span> 3; and the <cite>Black
Book</cite>, though perhaps not printed, must have been composed,
anterior to 1604. Whatever may have been the date of Nash’s
death, Malone (see <a href='https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/75607/pg75607-images.html#f728'>note</a> vol. v. p. 561) was assuredly mistaken
in interpreting the expression “humorous theft,” to mean
that Rowlands had stolen <cite>The letting of humours blood in the
head vaine</cite>, &#38;c. from Nash: that piece is much too weak and
spiritless to have been the production of the former.</p>

above 166<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> on each performance. The foregoing
extracts [from Sir Henry Herbert’s Office-book] show, that
there is not even a semblance of truth in this story. In the
year 1685, when the London theatres were much enlarged, and
the prices of admission greatly increased, Shadwell received by
his third day on the representation of The Squire of Alsatia, only
130<i>l.</i>, which Downes the prompter says was the greatest receipt
had been ever taken at Drury-lane playhouse at single prices.
<span lang="la"><cite>Roscius Anglicanus</cite></span>, p. 41. The use of Arabick figures has often
occasioned very gross errors to pass current in the world. I
suppose the utmost receipt from the performance of Middleton’s
play for nine days (if it was performed so often), could not
amount to more than one hundred and fifty pounds. To the
sum of 150<i>l.</i> which perhaps this old actor had seen as the profit
made by this play, his fancy or his negligence added a cipher,
and thus made fifteen hundred pounds. The play of Holland’s
Leaguer [by Marmyon] was acted six days successively at
Salisbury Court, in December 1631, and yet Sir Henry Herbert
received on account of the six representations but <em>one pound
nineteen shillings</em>, in virtue of the <em>ninth</em> share which he possessed
as one of the proprietors of that house. Supposing there
were twenty-one shares divided among the actors, the piece,
though performed with such extraordinary success, did not produce
more than <em>six pounds ten shillings</em> each night, exclusive
of the occasional nightly charges already mentioned.” Malone’s

<cite>Michaelmas Term</cite>. They are given by Chetwood in “An
Account of the Author,” prefixed to a reprint of <cite>Blurt Master
Constable</cite>, which forms part of a small volume entitled <cite>A Select
Collection of Old Plays</cite>, Dublin, 1750. Middleton, as Chetwood
previously informs us, “lived to a very great age....
We may judge of his longævity by his works; since his first
play was acted in 1601, and his last in 1665[!].... That
he was much esteem’d by his brother poets, we may judge
by four lines of sir William Lower upon his comedy call’d
<cite>A Michaelmas Term</cite>, 1663”! Now, <cite>Michaelmas Term</cite> was
certainly not produced in Middleton’s “halting age,” having
been licensed the 15th May, 1607, and printed during the same
year; see vol. i. p. 413; there is no edition of it bearing date
1663; and, moreover, <em>Sir William Lower died in</em> 1662. The
lines are cited indeed by Oldys, in a MS. note on Langbaine’s
<cite>Account of Engl. Dram. Poets</cite>, p. 373 (British Museum); but
he doubtless copied them from Chetwood’s volume, of which

<p class='c001'>In an address “To the Readers” prefixed to the 4to of
<cite>Sejanus</cite>, 1605, Ben Jonson says, “Lastly, I would inform
you, that this book, in all numbers, is not the same with that
which was acted on the public stage; wherein a second pen
had good share: in place of which, I have rather chosen to
put weaker, and, no doubt, less pleasing, of mine own, than to
defraud so happy a genius of his right by my loathed usurpation.”
On this passage Gifford remarks, “Why might not
Chapman or Middleton be intended here? they, like Shakspeare
[who, according to the commentators, was the person
alluded to], were living in habits of kindness with the poet:
they wrote in conjunction with him; they were both men of
learning; and no great violation seems offered to language (at
least no greater than courtesy would excuse) in terming them
<em>happy geniuses</em>.” Gifford, however, concludes that Fletcher
was the person actually meant. See B. Jonson’s <cite>Works</cite>,

powers, who has lately been the object of much discussion, on
account of the liberal use which Shakspeare is ascertained to
have made of his recently discovered tragi-comedy, <cite>The Witch</cite>.”

<p class='c001'>“Yet the spleen of Davies is more tolerable than the tedious
absurdity of the other commentators, who labour to justify our
great poet’s pronunciation of this word [Hecate] from a mass
of contemporary authorities, as if it was not a matter of the
utmost indifference, and determined, in every case, by the measure
of the verse. Shakspeare gave the word as he found it in
Middleton, without caring whether it were a dissyllable or a
trisyllable,” &#38;c. Note on B. Jonson’s <cite>Works</cite>, vol. vi. p. 282.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The production of this Masque [<cite>The Masque of Queens</cite>]
has subjected Jonson to a world of unmerited obloquy from the
commentators. It was written, it seems, ‘on account of the
success of Shakspeare’s Witches, which alarmed the jealousy
of a man, who fancied himself his rival, or rather his superior.’
And this is repeated through a thousand mouths. Not to
observe, that if Jonson was moved by any such passion, it must
be by Middleton’s Witches, not Shakspeare’s (for the latter
is but a copyist himself, in this case),” &#38;c. Note on B. Jonson’s

Gifford threw out these remarks, Malone had not declared his

the length of the acts in this drama. The stage-direction in
the old copies (see p. 367, <a href='#f875'>note</a>), shews plainly that a new act
commences with the entrance of “<i>Falso untrussed</i>;” and it
was necessary to close that act with the present scene, where
the Jeweller’s Wife, parting from her paramour at night, desires
him to come to her “to-morrow” about the same hour.
The morning of that “to-morrow” has arrived, when Phœnix
and Proditor enter in the next scene; during which, as the
reader will observe, time is supposed to pass away with astonishing
rapidity.</p>

“<i>Shortyard we banish</i>, ’tis <i>our pleasure</i>.”—I may remark that,
though the guilty are deservedly punished, the judge administers
justice somewhat arbitrarily in this scene, which is
evidently supposed to pass in a private dwelling.</p>

<p class='c038'>The footnote scheme used lettered references, repeating a-z. On numerous
of occasions, letters were skipped or repeated. The resequencing of notes
here resolves those lapses. Footnotes on occasion are themselves footnoted.
For uniqueness, these are referenced as, for example, ‘35A’.</p>

<p class='c038'>One unanchored footnote at p. 239 l. 10 was mentioned at the
bottom of that page, glossing the word ‘precept’. That anchor
has been added as 239.10.</p>

<p class='c038'>An errata section was prepated by the Editor and included
in this first volume, which provides additions and corrections
to all five volumes in this set. The relevant sections will be
repeated at the end of the Transcriber’s note of each subsequent
volume.</p>

<p class='c038'>Stage directions, except for entrances, can be:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>in-line</dt>
    <dd>in the middle of a line and delimited with ‘[ ]’,
    </dd>
    <dt>end of line</dt>
    <dd>right-justified on the same line where there is room, with only the leading ‘[’,
    </dd>
    <dt>next line</dt>
    <dd>right-justified on the following line, where there is insufficent room, with a hanging 
    indent.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c038'>The same convention is followed here. Since this version is wider than the
original, most directions are on the same line as the speech.</p>

<p class='c038'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have
been corrected, and are noted here. The references are to the
page and line in the original.</p>
